Does this prop even work with angles greater than 180 degrees?
How do you describe an angle greater than 180 degrees using 3 points? How would that be different than the angle on the other side?

Euclid's angles are constrained between 0 and 2 right angles[here](http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce%20/java/elements/bookI/defI9.html)
